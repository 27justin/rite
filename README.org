* rite

*rite* is a modern C++-based (web-)server framework.

*rite* is currently UNIX-only.  It heavily relies on ~epoll~, while I
would appreciate a Windows port of our networking implementation, I
can't provide this myself.

** Features
+ Asynchronous & concurrent by design
+ Programmable request pipeline (on_receive, pre_send, post_send)
+ Highly extensible at every step of the pipeline
+ Support for HTTP/1.1 as well as HTTP/2 (TLS only, no h2c)

** Disclaimer
This project is still very much WIP and *not yet* suitable for
production use.  There are known race-conditions and potential buffer
overflows that still have to be accounted for, this project is still
in it's infancy and currently a playground for new ideas and API
design.
