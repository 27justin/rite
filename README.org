* rite

*rite* is a modern C++23 (web-)server framework.

** Platforms
+ Linux

*rite* is currently Linux only.  I do not have access to a windows
development environment and have zero clue about windows networking.

Contributions would be heavily appreciated though!

** Features
+ Asynchronous & concurrent by design
+ Programmable request pipeline (on_receive, pre_send, post_send)
+ Support for HTTP/1.1 as well as HTTP/2 (TLS only, no h2c)

** Disclaimer
This project is still very much WIP and *not yet* suitable for
production use.  There are known race-conditions and potential buffer
overflows that still have to be accounted for, this project is still
in it's infancy and currently a playground for new ideas and API
design.

** Example
Take a look at the [[examples/][examples folder]] to get introduced to programming with rite.
