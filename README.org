* Project Name pending (codename: kana)

<Project-Name> is an experiment by me at writing a highly concurrent,
scalable HTTP server/(-framework) in C++.

As of now, it supports:
+ High concurrency
+ Request hooks (on_receive, pre_send, post_send, close, etc.)
+ Asynchronous endpoints
+ Thread-pooled endpoints
+ Regex & normal path mapping
+ Extensions
+ High performance (2025-01-07, Avg. 242,828/req per second on 10
  worker threads with a simple echo endpoint)
+ HTTP/1.0, /1.1 and /2 with SNI
+ Modifiable during runtime

I'm making no guarantees on it's reliability.  It should be somewhat
safe to use, but when load-testing the server, data-races may occur
due to the connection management.
